# To install, you must have:
1. Created and activated a conda environment based on python3 (preferable 3.8 or later).
2. Cloned the 220_grader repo
3. Done a `cd 220_grader`

You can then do `make install` and it will install pandas and other packages in that environment/

You then always run the grader when that environment is activated.
